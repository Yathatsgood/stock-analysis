# Overview of stock-analysis
### Purpose

In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.


### Results

The new refactored code runs a lot more smoothly than the old code.-


### Summary
#### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

###### Advantages

-Your code will run faster

-Your code will be cleaner

-You will have an easier time understanding what the code is doing

-Bugs and issues are easier to find and fix in cleaner refactored code

###### Disadvantages

-It can take a lot of time to refactor code

-Can lead to breaking code when trying to trim

-With bigger projects you will need a lot of dedicated time to refactor code

-Though it can be nice to have refactored code, it is not always necessary

#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

I believe with such a small project and such a small amount of data needing to be calculated, refactoring the code is useless. Yes, the original code may have been messier but I believe it was still readable. Both of the advantages and disadvantages I listed apply to the refactored code. It does run faster and is cleaner, though at the same time, I broke the code quite a few times trying to refactor it and in the end the amount of time saved on the calculations is negligible in the long run.
